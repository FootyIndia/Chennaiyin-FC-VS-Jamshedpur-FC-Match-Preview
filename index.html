      <p>
        Chennaiyin FC are all set to host Jamshedpur FC in their sixth game of the season at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Chennai. Both teams come into this game with a loss in their previous game. It will be an early kick-off at 5:30 PM IST.
        <br>
        <br />
        Chennaiyin FC were thrashed 6-2 at home by Mumbai City FC in their last game. They were totally outplayed in all parts of the pitch against the Islanders. Coming into this game, the Marina Machans are
        currently placed 7th in the league with 2 wins, a draw and 2 losses in 5 games. Speaking ahead of the game, Chennaiyin Head Coach Thomas Brdaric added,<strong> "It was one game(against MCFC) that we lost, but it's not the end of the year and of the world.
          Every teams have these situations and we should run on them"</strong>.

        Jamshedpur FC come into this game with a narrow 1-0 loss against defending champions Hyderabad FC at the Furnace. The Defending League Shield Winners have managed to pick up just one win from 5 games this season. They have lost their last two games and
        the pressure is mounting on Head Coach Aidy Boothroyd to deliver. Addressing the media ahead of the game, Boothroyd added,
        <strong> "We want to be much further up the table and everybody would be happy. This is what football is, itâ€™s ups and downs."</strong>
      </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Head-to-Head:</b></h4>
        <p>
    Both these sides have faced each other 10 times in the league so far and Chennaiyin FC have been on the winning side 4 times. Jamshedpur FC have 3 wins and the other 3 games have ended in a draw. The Red miners thrashed Chennaiyin FC 4-1 in the last meeting between these two sides
      in the Hero ISL last season.
      </p>
      <h4><b class="heading">Team News:</b></h4>
        <p>
          Chennaiyin FC head coach Thomas Brdaric confirmed that Karikari is expected to be back from injury. Also Iranian Defender Vafa Hakhamaneshi will return after serving a one game suspension following his red card against East Bengal FC. Narayan Das will miss the game with an
          hamstring injury which he picked up against East Bengal.
          <br />
          <br />
          Jamshedpur FC are hit hard by injuries at the moment. Head Coach Aidy Boothroyd confirmed injuries to midfielder Germanpreet Singh and defenders Eli Sabia, Dinliana Renthlei and Laldinpuia. On a positive note, Komal Thatal has resumed training.
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Probable Lineups:</b></h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Chennaiyin FC:</strong> Debjit(GK), Ajith Kumar, Vafa Hakhamaneshi, Fallou Diagne, Aakash Sangwan, Jiteshwor Singh, Julius Duker, Anirudh Thapa, Rahim Ali, Petar Sliskovic, Vincy Barretto.
          <br>
          <br />
          <strong>Jamshedpur FC:</strong> Rehenseh TP(GK), Muhammad Uvais, Pratik Chaudhari, Peter Hartley, Ricky, Jitendra Singh, Wellington Priori, Farukh Choudhary, Boris Singh, Harrison Sawyer, Daniel Chima.
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Key Players:</b></h4>

          <p>
            <strong>Vafa Hakhamaneshi</strong> will be the key player for Chennaiyin FC. Without the Iranian Defender, Chennaiyin FC shipped in 6 goals in their last game. Up against the likes of physically strong strikers like Chima and Sawyer, Chennaiyin will need Vafa to step
            up his game and help out the team defensively.
          </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Peter Hartley</strong> will be Jamshedpur FC's most important player. With first team regulars Eli Sabia and Dinliana out injured, Aidy Boothroyd will be expecting his captain to command the backline and put out a strong display against a decent Chennaiyin attack.
            Hartley's battle against Petar Sliskovic will be an interesting one to watch out for.
